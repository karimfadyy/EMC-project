      <h2>A Timeline of Discovery</h2>
      <p>The Egyptian Museum in Cairo stands as a testament to Egypt's rich and enduring history. From its inception in
        the 19th century to its current status as a world-renowned institution, the museum has played a pivotal role in
        preserving and showcasing the treasures of ancient Egypt. Below is a detailed timeline highlighting the key
        milestones in the museum's storied past.</p>

        <div class="date">1835</div>
        <div class="description">
          <p>In 1835, the Egyptian government took a significant step towards preserving its ancient heritage by
            establishing the first service dedicated to protecting antiquities. This initiative marked the beginning of
            organized efforts to safeguard Egypt's rich archaeological treasures, which had been subject to looting and
            unauthorized exports. The move demonstrated a growing awareness of the importance of cultural preservation
            and laid the groundwork for future institutions dedicated to Egyptology.</p>

          <p>In 1858, French archaeologist Auguste Mariette was appointed as the first officer to oversee Egypt's
            antiquities, marking the establishment of the Antiquities Department. Recognizing the need for a dedicated
            space to house Egypt's vast array of ancient artifacts, Mariette founded the first museum in Bulaq, situated
            in a converted warehouse along the Nile. This museum served as the initial repository for many significant
            discoveries, reflecting Mariette's dedication to collecting and preserving Egypt's antiquities within the
            country.</p>

        <div class="description">
          <p>In 1878, a devastating flood of the Nile River severely damaged the Bulaq Museum, highlighting the
            vulnerability of the collection's location. This disaster underscored the necessity for a more secure and
            suitable facility to house Egypt's invaluable artifacts. The event catalyzed discussions and plans for
            relocating the museum to a safer environment, ensuring better protection for the nation's heritage.</p>

          <p>Following the flood, the museum's collections were moved in 1891 to a former royal palace in the Giza
            district of Cairo. This relocation provided a more stable environment for the artifacts and allowed for
            better organization and display. The Giza location served as an interim solution while plans for a permanent
            museum building were developed, reflecting the ongoing commitment to preserving Egypt's antiquities.</p>

          <p>The current Egyptian Museum building in Tahrir Square was officially opened in 1902. Designed by French
            architect Marcel Dourgnon, the neoclassical structure was constructed by the Italian company of Giuseppe
            Garozzo and Francesco Zaffrani. This purpose-built museum was the first of its kind in the Middle East and
            North Africa, symbolizing a significant advancement in the preservation and exhibition of ancient artifacts.

          <p>The discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922 by Howard Carter brought unprecedented attention to the
            Egyptian Museum. The tomb's treasures, including the iconic golden mask, were transferred to the museum,
            significantly enhancing its collection. This event captivated the world and solidified the museum's status
            as a premier institution for Egyptology, attracting scholars and tourists alike.</p>

          <p>In 1954, a portion of the museum's garden, which extended to the Nile, was repurposed for the construction
            of the Cairo Municipality Building. This development reduced the museum's outdoor space but also reflected
            the evolving urban landscape of Cairo. Despite these changes, the museum continued to adapt and maintain its
            role as a guardian of Egypt's ancient heritage.</p>

          <p>Wafaa El Saddik was appointed as the first female director general of the Egyptian Museum in 2004. Her
            leadership marked a progressive step in the institution's history, emphasizing inclusivity and
            modernization. Under her guidance, the museum undertook various initiatives to enhance its exhibitions and

          <p>During the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, the museum faced significant challenges, including break-ins and
            the destruction of two mummies. Several artifacts were damaged, and around 50 objects were stolen. The
            incident highlighted the vulnerabilities of cultural institutions during times of political unrest.
            Restoration efforts were promptly initiated, and by 2013, many of the damaged items were recovered and
            displayed in a special exhibition titled "Damaged and Restored."</p>

            transported 22 royal mummies from the Egyptian Museum to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization. This
            historic procession showcased Egypt's commitment to honoring its ancient rulers and preserving their
